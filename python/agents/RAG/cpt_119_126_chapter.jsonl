Codes 20700, 20702, 20704 are add-on codes for the manual preparation and insertion of the drug-delivery device(s). They may be used with any open procedure code except those that include the placement of a \u201cspacer\u201d (eg, 27091, 27488). The add-on codes may be used when infection is present, suspected, or anticipated during the surgery. The location of the primary service determines which of the insertion codes may be selected. If the primary surgery is in the deep (subfascial) region, add-on code 20700 may be reported. If the primary surgery is within the bone or \u201cintramedullary,\u201d add-on code 20702 may be reported. If the primary surgery is within the joint, add-on code 20704 may be reported. Codes 20701, 20703, 20705 are add-on codes used to report removal of drug-delivery device(s). These codes may be typically associated with specific surgeries if the infection has been eradicated. For removal of a drug-delivery device from a deep (subfascial) space performed in conjunction with a primary procedure (ie, complex wound closure [13100-13160], adjacent tissue transfer [14000-14350], or a flap closure [15570-15758]), add-on code 20701 may be reported. For infection that has not been eradicated, see the tissue debridement codes (eg, 11011, 11012, 11042, 11043, 11044, 11045, 11046, 11047) for the primary procedure. If a subsequent new drug-delivery device is placed, 20700 may be additionally reported. Similarly, for add-on code 20703, removal of drug delivery device from the bone may be associated with different procedures. If the infection has been eradicated and the drug delivery device removal is the only procedure being performed, report 20680 (removal of deep hardware). Bony reconstruction performed in conjunction with eradication of infection may be reported using the reconstruction as the primary procedure.

In the rare circumstance in which only part of the joint is destroyed by infection, a partial arthroplasty may be reported (eg, 23470, 24360, 24361, 24362, 24365, 24366, 25441, 25442, 25443, 25444, 25445, 27125, 27236, 27438, 27440, 27441, 27442, 27443, and 27446).
